## 4. <a name='TheChallenge'></a>The Challenge

* The API design must use the best practices described in the next hackernoon publication.
* **Some of the most important things in the publication are:**
  * Endpoints must use the corresponding HTTP verbs for every action:
    * GET for retrieve data from server.
    * POST for create a new server resource.
    * PUT for update a server resource.
    * DELETE for remove a resource.
    * Server responses must use the HTTP status codes for the corresponding response:
    * 2xx for a successful response.
    * 4xx for not found resources.
    * 5xx for error responses.
    * Use the API versioning prefix.
    * You could use the search, ordering, filtering and pagining recommendation if you want.
    * YOU MUST validate the payload with every request (check for correct values, datatypes and params schema).
    * All the data must be stored using a RELATIONAL database, anyone, choose the one you like and makes your job easier.
    * All the queries to the database must use FUNCTIONS, STORED PROCEDURES or a similar mechanism.
    * Authentication must use JSON Web Tokens.
    * YOU MUST use all the frontend and backend dependencies with a package manager.
* **For the frontend use one of the following:**
  * VanillaJS, take advantage of the new EcmaScript functionalities.
  * Use some of the frontend frameworks listed in the 2017 state of javascript.
  * Use some of the programming languages that transpiles to javascript.
  * You COULD use a CSS framework like bootstrap or foundation, but itâ€™ll be great if you implement a CSS preprocessor.
  * All the source code MUST use a formating style (eslint, editorconfig).
* **Consider the following things for the creation of the blog:**
  * Only registered users can publish.
  * Anyone can see the publications.
  * Only registered users can add comments to the publications.
  * Publications must have a category.
* **All the source code must be versioned using a public git repository in GitHub or GitLab.**
